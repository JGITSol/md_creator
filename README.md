# README_MD_GENERATOR


TLDR: Simple tool to fill in a bit of art into code, personalize inputs as you want.

The given Python script generates a customized README.md file for a project. It prompts the user to input the project name and description, and then constructs the README content by combining a predefined header, an ASCII art representation of the project name, the user-provided description, and a footer.

The key functionalities of the script include:

Reading optional header and footer content from external files (if available).
Collecting user input for the project name and description.
Creating an ASCII art representation of the project name.
Constructing the final README.md content by combining all the elements.
The generated README.md file serves as documentation for the project, providing essential information for users and contributors.
